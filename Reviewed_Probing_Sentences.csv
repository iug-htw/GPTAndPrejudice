"Sir Walter Elliot, of Kellynch Hall, in Somersetshire, was a man who, for his own amusement, never took up any book but the Baronetage; there he found occupation for an idle hour, and consolation in a distressed one; there his faculties were roused into admiration and respect, by contemplating the limited remnant of the earliest patents; there any unwelcome sensations, arising from domestic affairs changed naturally into pity and contempt as he turned over the almost endless creations of the last century; and there, if every other leaf were powerless, he could read his own history with an interest which never failed.",simplify by splitting the sentence into smaller parts then paraphrase each part for better clarity and readability.
"Then followed the history and rise of the ancient and respectable family, in the usual terms; how it had been first settled in Cheshire; how mentioned in Dugdale, serving the office of high sheriff, representing a borough in three successive parliaments, exertions of loyalty, and dignity of baronet, in the first year of Charles II, with all the Marys and Elizabeths they had married; forming altogether two handsome duodecimo pages, and concluding with the arms and motto:--""Principal seat, Kellynch Hall, in the county of Somerset,"" and Sir Walter's handwriting again in this finale:--

His good looks and his rank had one fair claim on his attachment; since to them he must have owed a wife of very superior character to any thing deserved by his own.,simplify by splitting the sentence into smaller parts then paraphrase each part for better clarity and readability.
"Lady Elliot had been an excellent woman, sensible and amiable; whose judgement and conduct, if they might be pardoned the youthful infatuation which made her Lady Elliot, had never required indulgence afterwards.--She had humoured, or softened, or concealed his failings, and promoted his real respectability for seventeen years; and though not the very happiest being in the world herself, had found enough in her duties, her friends, and her children, to attach her to life, and make it no matter of indifference to her when she was called on to quit them.--Three girls, the two eldest sixteen and fourteen, was an awful legacy for a mother to bequeath, an awful charge rather, to confide to the authority and guidance of a conceited, silly father.",simplify by splitting the sentence into smaller parts then paraphrase each part for better clarity and readability.
"She had, however, one very intimate friend, a sensible, deserving woman, who had been brought, by strong attachment to herself, to settle close by her, in the village of Kellynch; and on her kindness and advice, Lady Elliot mainly relied for the best help and maintenance of the good principles and instruction which she had been anxiously giving her daughters.",simplify by splitting the sentence into smaller parts then paraphrase each part for better clarity and readability.
"That Lady Russell, of steady age and character, and extremely well provided for, should have no thought of a second marriage, needs no apology to the public, which is rather apt to be unreasonably discontented when a woman does marry again, than when she does not; but Sir Walter's continuing in singleness requires explanation.",simplify by splitting the sentence into smaller parts then paraphrase each part for better clarity and readability.
"Be it known then, that Sir Walter, like a good father, (having met with one or two private disappointments in very unreasonable applications), prided himself on remaining single for his dear daughters' sake.",simplify by splitting the sentence into smaller parts then paraphrase each part for better clarity and readability.

"Mary had acquired a little artificial importance, by becoming Mrs Charles Musgrove; but Anne, with an elegance of mind and sweetness of character, which must have placed her high with any people of real understanding, was nobody with either father or sister; her word had no weight, her convenience was always to give way--she was only Anne.",simplify by splitting the sentence into smaller parts then paraphrase each part for better clarity and readability.
Lady Russell loved them all; but it was only in Anne that she could fancy the mother to revive again.,simplify by splitting the sentence into smaller parts then paraphrase each part for better clarity and readability.
"A few years before, Anne Elliot had been a very pretty girl, but her bloom had vanished early; and as even in its height, her father had found little to admire in her, (so totally different were her delicate features and mild dark eyes from his own), there could be nothing in them, now that she was faded and thin, to excite his esteem.",simplify by splitting the sentence into smaller parts then paraphrase each part for better clarity and readability.

"It was so with Elizabeth, still the same handsome Miss Elliot that she had begun to be thirteen years ago, and Sir Walter might be excused, therefore, in forgetting her age, or, at least, be deemed only half a fool, for thinking himself and Elizabeth as blooming as ever, amidst the wreck of the good looks of everybody else; for he could plainly see how old all the rest of his family and acquaintance were growing.",simplify by splitting the sentence into smaller parts then paraphrase each part for better clarity and readability.

"He had not been known to them as a boy; but soon after Lady Elliot's death, Sir Walter had sought the acquaintance, and though his overtures had not been met with any warmth, he had persevered in seeking it, making allowance for the modest drawing-back of youth; and, in one of their spring excursions to London, when Elizabeth was in her first bloom, Mr Elliot had been forced into the introduction.",simplify by splitting the sentence into smaller parts then paraphrase each part for better clarity and readability.

"The disgrace of his first marriage might, perhaps, as there was no reason to suppose it perpetuated by offspring, have been got over, had he not done worse; but he had, as by the accustomary intervention of kind friends, they had been informed, spoken most disrespectfully of them all, most slightingly and contemptuously of the very blood he belonged to, and the honours which were hereafter to be his own.",simplify by splitting the sentence into smaller parts then paraphrase each part for better clarity and readability.
"Such were Elizabeth Elliot's sentiments and sensations; such the cares to alloy, the agitations to vary, the sameness and the elegance, the prosperity and the nothingness of her scene of life; such the feelings to give interest to a long, uneventful residence in one country circle, to fill the vacancies which there were no habits of utility abroad, no talents or accomplishments for home, to occupy.",simplify by splitting the sentence into smaller parts then paraphrase each part for better clarity and readability.

"Does it occur to you that there is any one article in which we can retrench?"" and Elizabeth, to do her justice, had, in the first ardour of female alarm, set seriously to think what could be done, and had finally proposed these two branches of economy, to cut off some unnecessary charities, and to refrain from new furnishing the drawing-room; to which expedients she afterwards added the happy thought of their taking no present down to Anne, as had been the usual yearly custom.",simplify by splitting the sentence into smaller parts then paraphrase each part for better clarity and readability.

Mr Shepherd, a civil, cautious lawyer, who, whatever might be his hold or his views on Sir Walter, would rather have the disagreeable prompted by anybody else, excused himself from offering the slightest hint, and only begged leave to recommend an implicit reference to the excellent judgement of Lady Russell, from whose known good sense he fully expected to have just such resolute measures advised as he meant to see finally adopted.",simplify by splitting the sentence into smaller parts then paraphrase each part for better clarity and readability.

"Sir Walter had at first thought more of London; but Mr Shepherd felt that he could not be trusted in London, and had been skilful enough to dissuade him from it, and make Bath preferred.",simplify by splitting the sentence into smaller parts then paraphrase each part for better clarity and readability.
"Two material advantages of Bath over London had of course been given all their weight:  its more convenient distance from Kellynch, only fifty miles, and Lady Russell's spending some part of every winter there; and to the very great satisfaction of Lady Russell, whose first views on the projected change had been for Bath, Sir Walter and Elizabeth were induced to believe that they should lose neither consequence nor enjoyment by settling there.",simplify by splitting the sentence into smaller parts then paraphrase each part for better clarity and readability.

"She was a clever young woman, who understood the art of pleasing--the art of pleasing, at least, at Kellynch Hall; and who had made herself so acceptable to Miss Elliot, as to have been already staying there more than once, in spite of all that Lady Russell, who thought it a friendship quite out of place, could hint of caution and reserve.",simplify by splitting the sentence into smaller parts then paraphrase each part for better clarity and readability.
"Lady Russell, indeed, had scarcely any influence with Elizabeth, and seemed to love her, rather because she would love her, than because Elizabeth deserved it.",simplify by splitting the sentence into smaller parts then paraphrase each part for better clarity and readability.
"She had been repeatedly very earnest in trying to get Anne included in the visit to London, sensibly open to all the injustice and all the discredit of the selfish arrangements which shut her out, and on many lesser occasions had endeavoured to give Elizabeth the advantage of her own better judgement and experience; but always in vain:  Elizabeth would go her own way; and never had she pursued it in more decided opposition to Lady Russell than in this selection of Mrs Clay; turning from the society of so deserving a sister, to bestow her affection and confidence on one who ought to have been nothing to her but the object of distant civility.",simplify by splitting the sentence into smaller parts then paraphrase each part for better clarity and readability.

""I presume to observe, Sir Walter, that, in the way of business, gentlemen of the navy are well to deal with.",simplify by splitting the sentence into smaller parts then paraphrase each part for better clarity and readability.
"I have had a little knowledge of their methods of doing business; and I am free to confess that they have very liberal notions, and are as likely to make desirable tenants as any set of people one should meet with.",simplify by splitting the sentence into smaller parts then paraphrase each part for better clarity and readability.
"Therefore, Sir Walter, what I would take leave to suggest is, that if in consequence of any rumours getting abroad of your intention; which must be contemplated as a possible thing, because we know how difficult it is to keep the actions and designs of one part of the world from the notice and curiosity of the other; consequence has its tax; I, John Shepherd, might conceal any family-matters that I chose, for nobody would think it worth their while to observe me; but Sir Walter Elliot has eyes upon him which it may be very difficult to elude; and therefore, thus much I venture upon, that it will not greatly surprise me if, with all our caution, some rumour of the truth should get abroad; in the supposition of which, as I was going to observe, since applications will unquestionably follow, I should think any from our wealthy naval commanders particularly worth attending to; and beg leave to add, that two hours will bring me over at any time, to save you the trouble of replying.""
Sir Walter only nodded.",simplify by splitting the sentence into smaller parts then paraphrase each part for better clarity and readability.
"But soon afterwards, rising and pacing the room, he observed sarcastically--
""There are few among the gentlemen of the navy, I imagine, who would not be surprised to find themselves in a house of this description.""
""They would look around them, no doubt, and bless their good fortune,"" said Mrs Clay, for Mrs Clay was present:  her father had driven her over, nothing being of so much use to Mrs Clay's health as a drive to Kellynch: ""but I quite agree with my father in thinking a sailor might be a very desirable tenant.",simplify by splitting the sentence into smaller parts then paraphrase each part for better clarity and readability.

""Indeed!"" was the reply, and with a look of surprise.",simplify by splitting the sentence into smaller parts then paraphrase each part for better clarity and readability.

"In fact, as I have long been convinced, though every profession is necessary and honourable in its turn, it is only the lot of those who are not obliged to follow any, who can live in a regular way, in the country, choosing their own hours, following their own pursuits, and living on their own property, without the torment of trying for more; it is only their lot, I say, to hold the blessings of health and a good appearance to the utmost: I know no other set of men but what lose something of their personableness when they cease to be quite young.""
It seemed as if Mr Shepherd, in this anxiety to bespeak Sir Walter's good will towards a naval officer as tenant, had been gifted with foresight; for the very first application for the house was from an Admiral Croft, with whom he shortly afterwards fell into company in attending the quarter sessions at Taunton; and indeed, he had received a hint of the Admiral from a London correspondent.",simplify by splitting the sentence into smaller parts then paraphrase each part for better clarity and readability.
"He was in the Trafalgar action, and has been in the East Indies since; he was stationed there, I believe, several years.""
""Then I take it for granted,"" observed Sir Walter, ""that his face is about as orange as the cuffs and capes of my livery.""
Mr Shepherd hastened to assure him, that Admiral Croft was a very hale, hearty, well-looking man, a little weather-beaten, to be sure, but not much, and quite the gentleman in all his notions and behaviour; not likely to make the smallest difficulty about terms, only wanted a comfortable home, and to get into it as soon as possible; knew he must pay for his convenience; knew what rent a ready-furnished house of that consequence might fetch; should not have been surprised if Sir Walter had asked more; had inquired about the manor; would be glad of the deputation, certainly, but made no great point of it; said he sometimes took out a gun, but never killed; quite the gentleman.",simplify by splitting the sentence into smaller parts then paraphrase each part for better clarity and readability.

"One wonders how the names of many of our nobility become so common.""
As Mr Shepherd perceived that this connexion of the Crofts did them no service with Sir Walter, he mentioned it no more; returning, with all his zeal, to dwell on the circumstances more indisputably in their favour; their age, and number, and fortune; the high idea they had formed of Kellynch Hall, and extreme solicitude for the advantage of renting it; making it appear as if they ranked nothing beyond the happiness of being the tenants of Sir Walter Elliot: an extraordinary taste, certainly, could they have been supposed in the secret of Sir Walter's estimate of the dues of a tenant.",simplify by splitting the sentence into smaller parts then paraphrase each part for better clarity and readability.
"It succeeded, however; and though Sir Walter must ever look with an evil eye on anyone intending to inhabit that house, and think them infinitely too well off in being permitted to rent it on the highest terms, he was talked into allowing Mr Shepherd to proceed in the treaty, and authorising him to wait on Admiral Croft, who still remained at Taunton, and fix a day for the house being seen.",simplify by splitting the sentence into smaller parts then paraphrase each part for better clarity and readability.

"Elinor saw, and pitied her for, the neglect of abilities which education might have rendered so respectable; but she saw, with less tenderness of feeling, the thorough want of delicacy, of rectitude, and integrity of mind, which her attentions, her assiduities, her flatteries at the Park betrayed; and she could have no lasting satisfaction in the company of a person who joined insincerity with ignorance; whose want of instruction prevented their meeting in conversation on terms of equality, and whose conduct toward others made every show of attention and deference towards herself perfectly valueless.",simplify by splitting the sentence into smaller parts then paraphrase each part for better clarity and readability.
"""Indeed!"" replied Lucy; ""I wonder at that, for I thought you must have seen her at Norland sometimes.",simplify by splitting the sentence into smaller parts then paraphrase each part for better clarity and readability.
"Then, perhaps, you cannot tell me what sort of a woman she is?""
""No,"" returned Elinor, cautious of giving her real opinion of Edward's mother, and not very desirous of satisfying what seemed impertinent curiosity; ""I know nothing of her.""
""I am sure you think me very strange, for enquiring about her in such a way,"" said Lucy, eyeing Elinor attentively as she spoke; ""but perhaps there may be reasons--I wish I might venture; but however I hope you will do me the justice of believing that I do not mean to be impertinent.""
Elinor made her a civil reply, and they walked on for a few minutes in silence.",simplify by splitting the sentence into smaller parts then paraphrase each part for better clarity and readability.

"Ferrars is certainly nothing to me at present--but the time may come--how soon it will come must depend upon herself--when we may be very intimately connected.""

""No; considering our situation, it was not strange.",simplify by splitting the sentence into smaller parts then paraphrase each part for better clarity and readability.

"Did you think he came directly from town?""
""No,"" replied Elinor, most feelingly sensible of every fresh circumstance in favour of Lucy's veracity; ""I remember he told us, that he had been staying a fortnight with some friends near Plymouth.""

"This picture, she had allowed herself to believe, might have been accidentally obtained; it might not have been Edward's gift; but a correspondence between them by letter, could subsist only under a positive engagement, could be authorised by nothing else; for a few moments, she was almost overcome--her heart sunk within her, and she could hardly stand; but exertion was indispensably necessary; and she struggled so resolutely against the oppression of her feelings, that her success was speedy, and for the time complete.",simplify by splitting the sentence into smaller parts then paraphrase each part for better clarity and readability.

"The youthful infatuation of nineteen would naturally blind him to every thing but her beauty and good nature; but the four succeeding years--years, which if rationally spent, give such improvement to the understanding, must have opened his eyes to her defects of education, while the same period of time, spent on her side in inferior society and more frivolous pursuits, had perhaps robbed her of that simplicity which might once have given an interesting character to her beauty.",simplify by splitting the sentence into smaller parts then paraphrase each part for better clarity and readability.

"She wanted to hear many particulars of their engagement repeated again, she wanted more clearly to understand what Lucy really felt for Edward, whether there were any sincerity in her declaration of tender regard for him, and she particularly wanted to convince Lucy, by her readiness to enter on the matter again, and her calmness in conversing on it, that she was no otherwise interested in it than as a friend, which she very much feared her involuntary agitation, in their morning discourse, must have left at least doubtful.",simplify by splitting the sentence into smaller parts then paraphrase each part for better clarity and readability.

Elinor was soon called to the card-table by the conclusion of the first rubber, and the confidential discourse of the two ladies was therefore at an end, to which both of them submitted without any reluctance, for nothing had been said on either side to make them dislike each other less than they had done before; and Elinor sat down to the card table with the melancholy persuasion that Edward was not only without affection for the person who was to be his wife; but that he had not even the chance of being tolerably happy in marriage, which sincere affection on her side would have given, for self-interest alone could induce a woman to keep a man to an engagement, of which she seemed so thoroughly aware that he was weary.",simplify by splitting the sentence into smaller parts then paraphrase each part for better clarity and readability.
"From this time the subject was never revived by Elinor, and when entered on by Lucy, who seldom missed an opportunity of introducing it, and was particularly careful to inform her confidante, of her happiness whenever she received a letter from Edward, it was treated by the former with calmness and caution, and dismissed as soon as civility would allow; for she felt such conversations to be an indulgence which Lucy did not deserve, and which were dangerous to herself.",simplify by splitting the sentence into smaller parts then paraphrase each part for better clarity and readability.
